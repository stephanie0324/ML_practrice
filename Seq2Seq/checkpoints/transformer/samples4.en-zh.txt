but it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm , from the current linear , command and control thinking , looking at efficiencies and optimization towards a much more flexible , a much more adaptive approach , where we recognize that redundancy , both in social and environmental systems , is key to be able to deal with a turbulent era of global change .	但這改變了我們的目標 , 從目前的線索和管理模式 , 從前線的角度來看效率 , 看看效率和偏見 , 更好的轉變 , 更適應 , 更適應 , 更適應 , 更有效的環境 , 更有效率 。
even the way people talk is shortcircuited such as when montag’s boss captain beatty describes the acceleration of mass culture: " speed up the film , montag , quick . click ? pic ? look , eye , now , flick , here , there , swift , pace , up , down , in , out , why , how , who , what , where , eh ? uh !	即使人們說話很短暫 , 像猴子的瓶頸一樣 , 像是大規模文化: 「 春天文化 」 : 「 春天 , 蒙特斯坦 , 克里斯 , 克里斯 , 為什麼 ?
here's a data point: 1 . 4 percent of the entire land surface is home to 40 percent of the species of higher plants , 35 percent of the species of vertebrates , and this 1 . 4 percent represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world , and this 1 . 4 percent of the entire land surface already provides for 35 percent of the ecosystem services that vulnerable people depend on .	數據的重點是:1.4%的表面是40%的溫度 , 45%的溫度 , 35%是25%的生物多樣性 , 大約是25%的25% 。
so if you want to know more about that , you know what i'm saying , we could talk about the antipiracy and all that , but as far as i'm concerned , you know , i believe in creative commons , and i think it's really important that , you know , that needs to be sustainable and everything , and i mean , as far as i'm concerned , i mean , this right here , this environment , i would like to sustain .	所以 , 如果你想知道我所說的 , 我們能談到的 「 創意 」 和我所說的 , 我相信 , 你知道嗎 ? 我相信 , 創造力很重要 , 我相信 , 很重要的是 , 你知道的 , 你知道的 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的意思是 , 我的 。
and it's important to make a distinction , because if the news is anything to go by , 40 percent of americans can't either can't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance , and have a president who , despite the protest of millions of his citizens even his own congress continues to prosecute a senseless war .	重要的是 , 如果新方法是 , 如果新方法是 , 40%的美國人無法承受健康照護 , 至少40%的醫療保健 , 或最高的醫療保險 , 至少有數百萬公平的預防 。
now , on any given day , you could find my siblings and i curled up in some part of our apartment reading , sometimes unhappily , because on summer days in new york city , the fire hydrant blasted , and to our immense jealousy , we could hear our friends down there playing in the gushing water , their absolute joy making its way up through our open windows .	現在 , 任何一天 , 你能找到我的姐妹和我在紐約的公園 , 有時 , 有時 , 有時 , 有時 , 有時 , 火車 , 火車在紐約市 , 火車 , 火車上 , 火車 , 開車 , 開車 , 開車 。
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance , where kids in japan are taking moves from a youtube video created in detroit , building on it within days and releasing a new video , while teenagers in california are taking the japanese video and remixing it with a philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself .	舞者在網路上創造了一整整整整套全球實驗室 , 孩子們在洛杉磯的影片 , 每天都在摧毀了一間新的影片 , 在加拿大的影片中 , 青少年 , 青少年的青少年紀錄片 。
we're a group of computer scientists , mathematicians , engineers and a cancer researcher , who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as government , we needed to examine the whole body , and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs , into the tissues , all the way to single cells , so that we could properly make a diagnosis .	我們是電腦科學家 , 數學學家 , 工程師、工程師、工程師、工程師、工程師、工程師、工程師 , 然後我們需要擴展整個體系 , 然後我們需要擴展整個體系 , 到各個組織 , 以外的細胞分析 。
and they've captured the process through familiar ways , through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices , because that small group of people , the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions , they might be small but every one of them has a blog , every one of them has been on fox or msnbc in the last week .	他們在熟悉的過程中捕捉了這些小型系統 , 透過一群小群人的聲音 , 因為這群小群人的聲音 , 答案是 , 是的 , 或者 , 每一群人的答案 , 都可能是 , 每一週的 , 每一群人都在過去一週內的一週內 , 每一週 , 每一週 , 每一週 , 每一週 , 每一週 , 透過一個小組小組短短短短短短短短暫的文字體內 , 透過一個小組時間 , 透過一個小群人的文字體系列 , 透過一個小群人的文字體系列 , 透過一個小群人的文字體內 , 透過一個小群小群小組小群小組時間 , 透過一個小組小組小組的一系列 , 透過一個小群小群小群人體系列 , 透過一個小組合 , 透過一個小群小群小組組
but i think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence , the true picture is actually probably more like this: ai starts out at this point here , at zero intelligence , and then , after many , many years of really hard work , maybe eventually we get to mouselevel artificial intelligence , something that can navigate cluttered environments as well as a mouse can .	但我認為 , 從科學領域的觀點來看 , 事實上 , 圖片可能更有可能是這樣的:一開始 , 0年來 , 0年後 , 許多年來 , 也許 , 許多年來 , 也許 , 也許 , 許多年來 , 即使我們有智慧的知識 。
and then we get the extremes: the far right , the far left , the extreme religious and the extreme antireligious , the far right dreaming of a golden age that never was , the far left dreaming of a utopia that never will be and the religious and antireligious equally convinced that all it takes is god or the absence of god to save us from ourselves .	然後我們得到了極端的目標 , 左邊的左邊 , 極端的宗教和極端宗教的夢想 , 遠遠遠遠遠遠離的夢想 , 遠遠遠遠離 , 遠離神奇的夢想 。
but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world , which is going to be the case with these technologies , when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial , which is already the case , and when they're almost impossible to police , it's not a question of if this is going to happen , it's when and where and how it's going to happen .	但當有數千個實驗室時 , 會發生這些技術 , 那就是大量的數量 。
so for example , numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas , it's not so much low taxes , low cost , low wages ; it's the skills of the area . particularly , the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area .	例如 , 營養研究研究顯示 , 如果你仔細觀察天氣的成長率的成長率 , 降低 , 降低 , 低的價格 , 低的價格 , 降低 , 低的價格 , 低的價格 。
what i'm saying is , when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood , all in furtherance of some hopedfor admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers , that that's too narrow a definition of success for our kids .	我說的是 , 當我們治療及掃描和掃描和掃描時 , 所有希望的孩子都能得到一系列的希望 , 所有希望一系列的同一系列 。
can't have enough of it it's our only way of life keeping , keeping on the grind keeping , keeping on the grind can't have enough of it it's our only way of life keeping , keeping on the grind keeping , keeping on the grind the mandem make some noise this next one is partly in kiswahili , which is what we speak in kenya .	不夠的 , 它只能保持生命的路徑 , 保持我們生命的唯一方式 , 保持生命 , 保持生命 , 保持持持持持持持久 , 保持下一步 , 持續下一步 , 保持下一步 。
as citizens , we are ready to decide on our common destinies , because we know that the way we distribute power says a lot about how we actually value everyone , and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another , and we are ready to do this in cities around the world right now .	身為公民 , 我們準備準備準備準備要決定我們要如何討論我們真正的價值 , 因為我們真的知道我們真的有多多多多的價值 , 因為我們知道 , 阿拉伯市政策有多多多多麼重要 , 因為我們知道 , 在一個城市裡 , 一個城市裡 , 一個地方 , 一個城市 , 因為我們現在正在進行一個城市 。
perhaps it's not a very insightful observation , but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by piero , in this case that remarkable painting that's in the uffizi , " the duke of montefeltro , " who faces his consort , battista .	也許這不是個很高的觀察 , 但事實上 , 我開始做一個方法 , 來做一個很簡單的觀察 , 來做這個案例 , 在這個案例中 , 在這個案例中 , 在這個案例中 , 他的痛苦的痛苦中 , 他的痛苦 。 」
but if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza , we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires , to make deliberate decisions about what they want , to talk about it with their partners , and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying , and we get to decide that .	但如果我們能創造出性教育 , 我們能創造出更多的教育 。
in doing so , we're going to necessarily encounter americans and innocent foreign citizens who are just going about their business , and so we have procedures in place that shreds that out , that says , when you find that , not if you find it , when you find it , because you're certain to find it , here's how you protect that .	這樣做 , 我們要承認美國人和創新的美國人 , 最近我們只會去找他們的商業 , 所以 , 我們的專業 , 所以 , 我們就證明 , 當你在那兒 , 哪裡 , 會發現 , 如果你發現 , 如果你發現 , 你有何時 , 你會發現 , 因為你有何時 , 會保護你 , 保護你 , 因為那是保護的 。
