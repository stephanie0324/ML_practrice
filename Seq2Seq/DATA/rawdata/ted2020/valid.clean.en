But what I like about this is , it boils down to someone on the street with a small , flat surface , a screwdriver , a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads because they often get dust on the contact heads and knowledge .
But when we were done , we found something that was sort of surprising .
I'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials .
It's really a question of scale .
And there's about 4 , 000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle .

I could create content in one language , FreeSpeech , and the person who's consuming that content , the person who's reading that particular information could choose any engine , and they could read it in their own mother tongue , in their native language .
So it was damaged . It's now repaired .
You simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous , spontaneous repair that occurs anyway .
And one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery .
And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate , because what it means that from anybody in this room , but particularly patients , you could now generate a bespoke , personalized tissue repair kit .
But you can just look at the form . You can look at the form .
So it turns out they're waterproof , and — right here is just fluorescent water , and I don't know if you can actually see this .
For a man , that's a risky proposition .
There's a tech startup in Shenzhen that grew to 300 , 000 students in just one year .

It's a greenhouse gas .
Thank you .
Where have I read them before ? Ah , yes .
RNG: Eh , I'm not holding my breath .
And the techies among you , you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be .
We can make spines that catch on simulated debris and collapse on removal to easily pull them out .
We have imagined products ; for example , this one: we imagined a bioinspired BandAid , where we took the glue off the BandAid .
But we think we got the dynamics right of the robot .
We can't tell you how many communications we're intercepting around the world , because to tell you that would be to invade your privacy .
It's about a program called " Bullrun . "
Some hands going up .
CA: So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations , access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down , has been closed down .

They are a site , along with others , that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill , and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online .
If you Google this , you'll find it .
And that , I think , can affect whether or not people want to share something , keep it private , or just keep it offline altogether .
The mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans , across a broad range of brain and body disabilities .

Thank you .
Synthetic cell technologies will power the next industrial revolution and transform industries and economies in ways that address global sustainability challenges .
The massive efforts to create synthetic cells have made us world leaders at writing DNA .
If we make the edges of those petals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diffraction , and now we have a great shadow .
We've been working on this for the last five or six years .
I stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room , how your lives might play this out , because I think on some gut level we do know this .
So we are trying different types of energy now , alternative energy , but it proved quite difficult to find something that's as convenient and as costeffective as oil , gas and coal .
So we built this machine in this garage here .
Well , it's true that some African fractals are , as far as I'm concerned , just pure intuition .
I didn't put his name up here my colleague , Kerry , in Kenya , has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure , because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village , it doesn't quite fit .
So we knew that we had some really solid science here .
In contrast to the SAMS technology rig , this is the banded one , where it's more tactile , it's more investigative , it's more apprehensive , and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go .
In short , we want to democratize access to information about our planet .
At the center , where the beams intersect , the atoms move sluggishly , as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it described as “optical molasses . ” A magnetooptical trap like this can cool atoms down to just a few microkelvins — about 273 degrees Celsius .
Let’s take numbers .
But that amount can be reduced through clever compression formats .
Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the 100 meters: thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt , the fastest man in history ; flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks .
And the beauty is , anybody can do it .
What I do know is that dozens of online job applications seem to just disappear into a black hole .
Homeless women used to be invisible to me but I appraise them now with curious eyes , wondering if their stories started like mine .

AB: Yes ? Good .
Seven .
Audience: Yeah ! AB: Good .
There's no question about it .
Come on , keep up .
Somebody's going to get my college grades out , a that's going to be a disaster . But it's going to be okay , and I will tell you that I am more scared of the bureaucrat that holds information in a desk drawer or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks , because ultimately , we'll be better off if we share .

KS: Two D . J . decks .
They weren't sampling these records to cash in on the familiarity of the original stuff .
